Groestlcoin Core 2.11
=====================

Intro
-----
Groestlcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run groestlcoin-qt.exe.

Groestlcoin Core is the original Groestlcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Groestlcoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a half hour to a hour or more.

See the groestlcoin forum at:

for more help and information.
